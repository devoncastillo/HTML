          <h3>About New York City</h3>
          <p>New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens,
            Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The city is the
            home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the
            City of New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is
            currently located on Liberty Island and commonly visited by
            tourists. However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore
            wasnâ€™t unveiled until 1886. Another tourist destination is Times
            Square. Times Square is commonly known for the big buildings,
            Broadway shows, and bright neon signs. This famous location was
            named after The New York Times after the Times moved to that
            location. Prior to that, it was named Longacre Square. New York
            City is also known for its bridges that connect the boroughs and
            allow ease of transportation.</p>
